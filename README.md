## Project Overview

[Trello Board](https://trello.com/b/QD7rXL7v/labs25hrfthierry)

[Product Canvas](https://whimsical.com/47hccoy2w65yxpK8dSfpwz)


Our team is developing an interactive map that identifies potential instances of police use of force across the United States of America for Human Rights First, an independent advocacy and action organization. 

 We're pulling data from similiar APIs(All locations V2 - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/2020PB/police-brutality/data_build/all-locations-v2.json, 846- https://api.846policebrutality.com/api/incidents) and from Twitter and Reddit. We want to identify aggregate these instances. 

Key Features

- Pulls and filters data from r/news
- Runs automatically
- Builds in Docker
- Pushable to AWS

## Tech Stack

### API built using:

- FastAPI

Why did we choose this framework?

- Built-in bootstrap
- Recommended to us
- Wanted to learn an in-demand framework

Other modules used:
- Pandas
- SciKit-Learn
- SpaCy
- newspaper3k
- PRAW
- fastapi-utils

# API Breakdown

The API, once running, automatically pulls and processes data from Reddit through PRAW

## PRAW

PRAW, The Python Reddit API Wrapper, makes it easy for users to analyze Reddit data. We used PRAW to scrape Reddit for potential instances of police of force.

# Environment Variables

In order for the app to function correctly, the user must set up their own environment variables. There should be a .env file containing the following inside the project folder locally before being built:

```
# These are the API keys generated when making a Reddit app
* PRAW_CLIENT_ID
* PRAW_CLIENT_SECRET
* PRAW_USER_AGENT
```
